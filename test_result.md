- **Non-blocking**: GUI doesn't pause the game
- **Clean Integration**: Works alongside existing module keybinds

## File Changes:
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/utils/mc/ChatUtils.java` - Updated prefix [N] → [S]
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/commands/CommandManager.java` - Removed FriendsCommand
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/gui/FriendsGui.java` - **NEW** - Complete friends management GUI
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/mixin/keyboard/MixinKeyboard.java` - Added apostrophe key handling

## Testing Protocol
The implementation has been completed and follows these testing guidelines:

1. **Basic Functionality**: Apostrophe key should open the friends GUI
2. **Add Friends**: GUI should allow adding friends with proper validation
3. **Remove Friends**: Individual and bulk removal with confirmations
4. **Search**: Friends list should be searchable/filterable
5. **Chat Messages**: All actions should show [S] prefixed messages
6. **No Command**: `.friends` command should no longer exist

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All requirements have been implemented. The friends command has been removed and replaced with a comprehensive ImGui-based friends management system accessible via the apostrophe (') key. Chat prefix changed from [N] to [S] as requested.

The implementation provides a much better user experience than the previous command-based system, with a modern GUI interface, search functionality, confirmation dialogs, and real-time feedback.
