# Scorn Client - Friends GUI Implementation Results

## Project Overview
This is a Minecraft Fabric client mod called "Scorn" with advanced combat systems and friend management features.

## User Requirements Completed
1. ✅ **Removed friends command** - FriendsCommand has been removed from CommandManager
2. ✅ **Created new ImGui friends GUI** - FriendsGui class created with full functionality
3. ✅ **Added apostrophe (') key binding** - Opens the friends management GUI
4. ✅ **Changed command prefix from [N] to [S]** - Updated in ChatUtils class

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Chat Prefix (ChatUtils.java)
- Changed all instances of "[N]" to "[S]" in ChatUtils.java
- Affects all system messages to use the new Scorn prefix

### 2. Removed Friends Command (CommandManager.java)
- Commented out and removed FriendsCommand from the command registry
- Friends are now managed exclusively through the GUI

### 3. Created Friends GUI (FriendsGui.java)
**New Features:**
- Modern ImGui-based interface with blue theme
- Add friends with input validation
- Search/filter friends list
- Remove individual friends with confirmation
- Clear all friends with confirmation
- Real-time friends count display
- Scrollable friends list
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. Added Key Binding (MixinKeyboard.java)
- Added handling for GLFW.GLFW_KEY_APOSTROPHE (') key
- Opens FriendsGui when pressed (only when no other screen is open)
- Integrated with existing module key binding system

## Technical Implementation

### Friends GUI Features:
- **Modern Design**: Blue-themed ImGui interface with consistent styling
- **Add Friend**: Input field with validation and duplicate checking
- **Friends List**: Scrollable list with search functionality
- **Remove Friends**: Individual remove buttons with confirmation dialog
- **Clear All**: Bulk clear with confirmation dialog
- **Search**: Real-time filtering of friends list
- **Status Messages**: Chat notifications for all actions with new [S] prefix

### Key Integration:
- **Apostrophe Key**: GLFW.GLFW_KEY_APOSTROPHE opens the friends GUI
- **Non-blocking**: GUI doesn't pause the game
- **Clean Integration**: Works alongside existing module keybinds

## File Changes:
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/utils/mc/ChatUtils.java` - Updated prefix [N] → [S]
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/commands/CommandManager.java` - Removed FriendsCommand
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/gui/FriendsGui.java` - **NEW** - Complete friends management GUI
- `/src/main/java/com/scorn/mixin/keyboard/MixinKeyboard.java` - Added apostrophe key handling

## Testing Protocol
The implementation has been completed and follows these testing guidelines:

1. **Basic Functionality**: Apostrophe key should open the friends GUI
2. **Add Friends**: GUI should allow adding friends with proper validation
3. **Remove Friends**: Individual and bulk removal with confirmations
4. **Search**: Friends list should be searchable/filterable
5. **Chat Messages**: All actions should show [S] prefixed messages
6. **No Command**: `.friends` command should no longer exist

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All requirements have been implemented. The friends command has been removed and replaced with a comprehensive ImGui-based friends management system accessible via the apostrophe (') key. Chat prefix changed from [N] to [S] as requested.

The implementation provides a much better user experience than the previous command-based system, with a modern GUI interface, search functionality, confirmation dialogs, and real-time feedback.
